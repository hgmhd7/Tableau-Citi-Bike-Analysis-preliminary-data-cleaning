Data cleaning/ munging for an analysis of trends in the City Bike program spanning the summers of 2017 through 2019.

Ultimately, this cleaned data was used for a deep dive analysis into the trends of the Citi Bike program to see If I could spot any areas that would be profitable for the company to focus on and grow in the future.
